# Password-Generator
This Password Genreator Project focused on adding and developing code to provided HTML, CSS and Script sources. Goals of this project  knowedge and application of Java-Script specifically studying strings, variables, functions, arrays, If-Else, concat, DO-WHILE loops, and event-listener. 

# Usage
 This practice will provide future potential employers the opportunity to see student works in early learning of Java-Script. 

# Features
This deployed and functional password generator will engage the user in a series of prompts asking the length and character choices of the password. When at least one character choice has been selected, the site will produce a generated password. This site limits the password be between 8 and 128 characters and will alert the user to some possible errors. 

# User Story (Provided)
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
